## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a 'lost' poem by Ovid from within the novel, one deemed too dangerous for the Emperor's contest, exploring a private grief masked as mythology.
- Draft the private correspondence between the patron Messalla and a political rival, discussing his 'stable' of poets as strategic assets.
- Create the journal entries of the tavern keeper Lucius, observing the poets' decline from inspired madmen to cautious courtiers.
- Script a dramatic scene where the four poets confront each other in the Subura tavern after one has seen the final, censored version of his inscribed poem.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build a text analysis tool that compares the 'public' inscribed verses of the poets with fragments of their earlier, private work, highlighting linguistic markers of censorship or self-editing.
- Design an interactive map of Augustan Rome marking key locations from the novel (The Grateful Sparrow, Messalla's house, the Forum building site) with pop-ups containing relevant historical context and fictional excerpts.
